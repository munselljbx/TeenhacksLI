#Given an input of a map of classrooms and a list of students with their courses, this program will calculate the most efficient schedule for each student.
#1. Input of map of classrooms, list of rooms with courses, list of students with courses into website
#2. JavaScript converts values into JSON and passes to Python
#3. Python pathfinder determines distances between all classrooms, passes information to main algorithm
#4. Main algorithm calculates most efficient schedules for students given distance
#5. Main algorithm optimizes schedules to minimize spread of distances
#6. List of students with schedules passed back to JavaScript through JSON
#7. Webpage updates through Flask and displays output
